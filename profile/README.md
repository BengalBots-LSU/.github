## Introduction
We are BengalBots which is the robotics club at Louisiana State University. We aim to develop the problem-solving, communication, and 
engineering skills of all our members through hands-on experience and outreach experience. We believe in attacking problems with a 
sense of curiousity and a fervor for learning.
